## What Was Completed Today (November 13, 2025)

### MOD-001: ELRS Receiver Installation ✅ COMPLETE

**Hardware Installed:**

- HappyModel ExpressLRS TCXO EP1 Dual RX
- Mounted in original DJI receiver bracket (hot glued, wrapped in heat shrink)

**Wiring:**

- UART3 used (R3/T3 pads) - NOT UART2 as originally planned
- EP1 RX (blue wire) → FC T3
- EP1 TX (blue wire/yellow ends) → FC R3
- EP1 5V (red wire) → FC 5V
- EP1 GND (red/black ends) → FC GND
- Wire: 24AWG silicone (signals), 24AWG stranded non-silicone (power)
- Twisted pairs for EMI reduction

**Antenna Configuration:**

- Primary: **Horizontal** (parallel to body), rear exit, **17.5mm CF clearance** ✅
- Secondary: **Vertical** (up/down), side behind VTX, **4mm CF clearance** ⚠️ (marginal)

- VTX Black → FC GND
- VTX Green (IRC Tramp RX) → FC T1 (UART1 TX)
- Wires: 24AWG, twisted, tinned, soldered, heat-shrunk
- Routed over top of FC (more room than between layers)

**VTX Antenna:**

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### 1. Betaflight Configuration (USB-powered bench test safe)

**UART Configuration:**

- **UART3**: Enable for Serial RX, set protocol to CRSF (ELRS receiver)
- **UART1**: Enable for VTX, set protocol to IRC Tramp (TX800 control)

**Critical Settings:**

- VTX: Set to **pit mode (25mW)** for USB testing
- Receiver: Not yet bound to transmitter

### 2. USB-Powered Video Bench Test

**Why USB is safe:**

- TX800 is 5V powered (3.7-5V range)
- Pit mode (25mW) draws minimal current
- FC provides 5V from USB
- **ANTENNA MUST BE CONNECTED** ⚠️

**Test checklist:**

- Power via USB only (no LiPo yet)
- Verify video feed in analog goggles
- Check camera angle (~10° upward for cruising)
- Verify OSD displays
- Test VTX control (channel switching via IRC Tramp)
- **DO NOT switch to high power (200/800mW) on USB!**

### 3. ELRS Receiver Binding

- Bind EP1 to transmitter
- Test control inputs (roll/pitch/yaw/throttle)
- Configure failsafe
- Verify RSSI in OSD

### 4. Full Power-Up Test (With LiPo)

**Prerequisites:**

- USB tests successful
- Receiver bound and tested
- Props OFF for initial power-up

**Test:**

- Connect 6S LiPo (GNB 1350mAh)
- Verify all systems operational
- Test VTX at higher power (200/800mW)
- Test motor outputs (props OFF!)

### 5. Pre-Flight Checks

- Install props (Gemfan 51433 Hurricane - grey front, yellow rear)
- Final antenna routing verification
- Full system check
- First hover test (LOS)

---

## Known Issues / Warnings

### Critical Safety Items

1. **TX800 Power**: 3.7-5V ONLY (NOT VBAT 22.2V!) - Would instantly destroy VTX
2. **VTX Antenna**: MUST be connected before powering VTX (even pit mode)
3. **Secondary ELRS antenna**: 4mm CF clearance (marginal - monitor for signal issues)

### Configuration Notes

1. **UART assignments different from plan**:
   - ELRS on UART3 (not UART2 as recommended)
   - VTX on UART1 (as planned)

2. **Camera angle verification needed**:
   - Design target: ~10° upward
   - Needs visual confirmation in goggles
   - Can add friction shim if angle needs adjustment

3. **Antenna routing adapted**:
   - ELRS primary horizontal (not vertical as originally planned)
   - Still achieves 90° diversity with vertical secondary

## Operator Preferences / Build Philosophy

**SpyD (Franco Nogarin) - Build Approach:**

- Self-sufficient: Designs/prints custom parts (Bambu X1C + AMS)
- Pragmatic: Tests prototypes before iteration (V1→V2→V3 camera mount)
- Resourceful: Photo → GIMP → Inkscape → Slicer workflow (no CAD software)
- Efficient: "Takes longer to loop you in than do it myself"
- Quality-focused: Twisted wire pairs for EMI, proper strain relief

**Documentation Style:**

- Appreciates technical accuracy over hand-holding
- Values engineering rationale ("why" not just "what")
- Expects archivist role (document, don't instruct)

---

## Build Context

**Aircraft History:**

- Purchased July 15, 2025 from Devon "Toasty" Felker ($273.12 CAD)
- Partial build: DJI O4 removed, no receiver
- 121 days from acquisition to first installations (Nov 13)

**Parts Timeline:**

- June 4, 2025: ELRS receiver + LEDs acquired (pre-purchase)
- July 17, 2025: Walksnail/batteries/props ordered
- July 24, 2025: Parts delivered
- Nov 2, 2025: HDZero system ordered ($829.98)
- Nov 13, 2025: **First installations completed!**

**Strategic Goals:**

- Analog first (max flight time 5-7 min)
- Evaluate if digital needed (Walksnail vs HDZero decision pending)
- HDZero test platform for potential fleet-wide transition
- Cruising build (not racing/freestyle)

## What to Tell the User

When next Claude instance starts:

"I've reviewed the handoff from the previous session. Excellent progress yesterday (Nov 13)! You completed:

- ✅ MOD-001: ELRS receiver fully installed
- ✅ MOD-002A: Camera/VTX fully installed
- ✅ All wiring soldered and secured
- ✅ All antennas mounted

**Ready for the next phase**: Betaflight configuration and bench testing.

Since the TX800 is 5V powered, we can safely test video over USB (pit mode 25mW) without a LiPo.

Shall we configure Betaflight and do the initial video test?"

# RD-59 "Nazgul" Session Handoff - November 14, 2025

**From**: Claude (Session ending at ~71k tokens)
**To**: Next Claude Instance
**Date**: November 14, 2025
**Session Summary**: Betaflight configuration and bench testing - TX800 VTX FAILED; strategic decisions made

---

## Critical Context

**Aircraft Type**: RD-59 "Nazgul" - **CRUISER BUILD** (not freestyle, not mapping)
- 10° camera angle for gentle cruising flight
- Focus on flight time and efficiency
- Manual FPV flying (not autonomous)

**Current Status**: ❌ NOT AIRWORTHY
- ✅ Receiver installed (MOD-001 complete - Nov 13)
- ✅ Camera/VTX wiring harness built (Nov 13)
- ✅ Betaflight 4.5.1 configured for analog VTX
- ❌ **TX800 VTX FAILED bench test** (Nov 14)
- ⏳ **Awaiting GEPRC RAD Mini 1W replacement VTX** (order pending)

---

## What Was Completed Today (November 14, 2025)

### Betaflight Configuration ✅ COMPLETE

**Environment:**
- FC: BLITZ ATF435 running Betaflight 4.5.1 (released Jan 16, 2025)
- Software: Betaflight Configurator 10.10.0
- Power: USB only (5V)

**Configuration Steps:**

1. **Initial Connection**:
   - FC detected as IFLIGHT_BLITZ_F435
   - Accelerometer calibration completed
   - Craft name: "Nazgul DC5 ECO" (already set)

2. **Discovered Old DJI O4 Configuration**:
   - UART1 (serial 0) was set to VTX (MSP + Displayport) - DJI digital config
   - UART3 (serial 2) already configured for Serial RX (CRSF) - correct for ELRS ✅

3. **VTX Table Configuration** (via CLI):
   - 5 bands: Boscam A, B, E, Fatshark, Raceband
   - 8 channels per band
   - 4 power levels: 25mW (PIT), 200mW, 400mW, 800mW (MAX)
   - Initial settings: Raceband 1 (5658MHz), Pit mode (25mW)

4. **UART1 Protocol Correction**:
   - Initial attempt: Generic VTX (function 2048) via CLI - WRONG
   - Correct configuration: **VTX (IRC Tramp)** via Ports tab in Configurator
   - Result: "Device ready: True" ✅ (VTX communication established)

5. **Final Configuration**:
   - UART1: IRC Tramp protocol for VTX control
   - UART3: CRSF for ELRS receiver
   - VTX halfduplex: ON
   - VTX low power disarm: UNTIL_FIRST_ARM (safe for benching)

**Result**: Betaflight fully configured and ready for analog VTX ✅

---

### TX800 Bench Test ❌ FAILED

**Test Setup:**
- Power: USB only (5V)
- Goggles: Analog FPV goggles
- Antenna: TrueRC CORE 85mm MMCX RHCP (connected throughout - no RF damage)

**Problems Discovered:**

1. **VTX Ran at Full Power Initially**:
   - Default VTX config had no power limits before our configuration
   - VTX likely running at 800mW on USB before pit mode configured
   - TX800 became **extremely hot** during initial USB connection
   - Heat persisted even after pit mode (25mW) configuration

2. **No Video Output**:
   - VTX communication with FC: ✅ Working (IRC Tramp, Device ready: True)
   - VTX LED status: Red/blue flashing 1 per second (indicates no video input from camera)
   - Goggles: No video signal on Raceband 1 (R1 - 5658MHz)
   - Tested at 200mW on R8: Still no video signal
   - Attempted manual VTX mode button: Behavior inconsistent, LEDs blocked by heatsink

3. **Excessive Heat**:
   - TX800 running dangerously hot even supposedly in pit mode (25mW)
   - Heat excessive even when "doing nothing"
   - LED indicators blocked by heatsink (poor design - cannot clearly see status)
   - VTX temperature abnormal for USB-powered pit mode operation

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Likely: Camera not providing video signal to VTX (red/blue LED pattern indicates this)
- Possible: Camera power issue (though wired correctly to 5V/GND)
- Possible: Video wire issue (though JST harness verified correct on Nov 13)
- Possible: VTX internal fault (cannot rule out)

**Operator Assessment**:
- TX800 problematic from day 1 (operator never happy with it)
- Poor design (LEDs blocked by heatsink)
- Previous underperformance on 3.5" build (suspected shorting issues)
- Excessive heat concerning (abnormal for pit mode on USB)
- **Trust lost** - combination of heat, no video, and day-1 frustration

**Test Result**: ❌ **BENCH TEST FAILED** - video system not operational

---

## Strategic Decisions Made (November 14, 2025)

### Decision 1: VTX Replacement - GEPRC RAD Mini 1W

**Selected VTX**: GEPRC RAD Mini 1W ($74)

**Rationale**:
- Operator already happy with GEPRC RAD from other builds (proven component)
- Analog VTX maximizes flight time for cruiser role (5-7 min expected)
- IRC Tramp protocol (Betaflight already configured for this - no changes needed)
- Lower cost than digital options
- Allows baseline analog testing as originally planned

**Status**: Order pending (operator will order when ready)

---

### Decision 2: ArduPilot Mapping Rebuild - REJECTED

**Operator researched converting RD-59 to ArduPilot mapping platform**, but decided against it.

**Why Rejected**:
- 5" freestyle frames have severe vibration/jello issues for mapping (high-RPM motors, flexible frame)
- Mapping requires 7" long-range frame with low-KV motors (1200-1400KV vs 1800KV)
- Proper mapping platform needs different design from ground up
- Camera requirements for mapping (12-20MP, down-facing or gimbal) add significant weight/complexity
- DJI Mini 4 Pro (operator owns) is NOT suitable for mapping (proprietary ecosystem, no Mission Planner integration)

**Strategic Decision**:
- **RD-59 remains manual FPV cruiser** on Nazgul frame (as originally planned)
- **Professional mapping platform will be separate future project** (7" frame, ArduPilot, proper camera)

---

### Decision 3: Fleet Strategy Clarified

**RD-59 Role in Fleet**:
- Manual FPV cruiser (10° camera angle, long flight time)
- Analog video system (GEPRC RAD)
- 5-7 min flight time target
- Gentle, relaxed flying style

**Other Fleet Aircraft**:
- **RD-53**: Manual FPV (short-range fun)
- **RD-54 "Zorro"**: Manual FPV (Walksnail Avatar, will get HDZero when it arrives)
- **RD-55 "Flylens75"**: Manual FPV (Walksnail Avatar)
- **RD-59 "Nazgul"**: Manual FPV cruiser (analog, long flight time)
- **Future mapping drone**: Separate build (7" frame, ArduPilot, dedicated platform)

**HDZero System** ($830, ordered Nov 2, in transit):
- Goggle 2 (red) with Echo Antenna Kit
- Freestyle V2 1W VTX Kit
- **Allocated to RD-54** for performance flying (not RD-59)

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### 1. Order GEPRC RAD Mini 1W VTX

**Pending**: Operator will order when ready ($74)

**Specs to Verify When Ordering**:
- GEPRC RAD Mini 1W (not the 400mW version)
- 25-800mW power range
- IRC Tramp protocol support
- 5V or VBAT power input (verify compatibility)
- MMCX antenna connector (to reuse TrueRC CORE antenna)

---

### 2. Remove Failed TX800 and Install GEPRC RAD

**When GEPRC RAD Arrives**:

1. **Power off and disconnect everything**

2. **Remove TX800**:
   - Disconnect VTX from harness (JST connector)
   - Remove VTX antenna (MMCX - careful not to damage)
   - Unmount TX800 from frame
   - Set aside as spare/test part

3. **Install GEPRC RAD**:
   - Mount GEPRC RAD in same location (or better location if available)
   - Connect TrueRC CORE 85mm MMCX antenna to GEPRC RAD
   - Connect GEPRC RAD to existing wiring harness:
     - Red (5V) → already wired to FC 5V
     - Black (GND) → already wired to FC GND
     - Green/Yellow (IRC Tramp control) → already wired to FC T1 (UART1 TX)
     - Video In → already wired to camera Yellow wire
   - Verify all connections secure
   - **CRITICAL**: Antenna must be connected before powering VTX

4. **Verify Power Requirements**:
   - Check if GEPRC RAD is 5V or VBAT powered
   - Current harness wired to 5V (TX800 was 5V only)
   - If GEPRC RAD needs VBAT, rewire power to VBAT pad

---

### 3. USB-Powered Video Bench Test

**Prerequisites**:
- GEPRC RAD installed
- Antenna connected (**CRITICAL** - never power VTX without antenna)
- Harness verified

**Test Procedure**:
1. Connect FC to USB only (no LiPo)
2. Power on analog goggles
3. Set goggles to Raceband 1 (R1 - 5658MHz) or band/channel configured in Betaflight
4. Verify video feed appears in goggles
5. Check camera angle (~10° upward for cruising)
6. Verify OSD displays (battery voltage, craft name, etc.)
7. Test VTX control via Betaflight VTX tab (channel switching)
8. **Keep in pit mode (25mW) for USB testing** - do NOT switch to high power on USB

**Expected Result**:
- Video signal in goggles ✅
- OSD visible ✅
- Camera angle correct (~10° upward) ✅
- VTX communication working (Device ready: True) ✅

**If Successful**: Proceed to ELRS binding

**If Failed**: Troubleshoot camera/video signal (but GEPRC RAD is proven component, should work)

---

### 4. ELRS Receiver Binding

**Prerequisites**:
- USB or LiPo power to FC
- Transmitter: RadioMaster Boxer with Ranger Micro ELRS TX module
- Binding phrase must match between TX and RX

**Binding Procedure**:

1. **Put Receiver in Bind Mode** (choose one method):
   - **Method A**: Use Betaflight CLI: `bind_rx` command, then reboot
   - **Method B**: Short bind pads on EP1 receiver before powering on
   - **Method C**: Use Betaflight Receiver tab (if available)

2. **Put Transmitter in Bind Mode**:
   - Access ELRS Lua script on Boxer
   - Select "Bind" option
   - Transmitter starts broadcasting bind packets

3. **Wait for Bind**:
   - EP1 receiver should bind automatically (matching binding phrase)
   - LED on receiver changes pattern (rapid flash → solid/slow flash)
   - Betaflight Receiver tab shows RSSI and link quality

4. **Test Control Inputs**:
   - Move sticks on Boxer → Should see response in Betaflight Receiver tab
   - Roll/pitch/yaw/throttle all responding
   - Flight mode switches working
   - RSSI displaying correctly

5. **Configure Failsafe**:
   - Set failsafe mode in Betaflight (Drop, Land, or RTH)
   - Test failsafe: Power off transmitter → FC should enter failsafe mode

**Expected Result**: Full RC control via ELRS ✅

---

### 5. LiPo-Powered Full System Test

**Prerequisites**:
- Video system working (USB test passed)
- ELRS receiver bound and tested
- **Props OFF** (critical for bench test)

**Test Procedure**:

1. **Connect 6S LiPo** (GNB 1350mAh):
   - Verify polarity correct
   - Connect XT60 connector
   - **Props must be OFF**

2. **Power-On Checks**:
   - FC boots normally
   - Video feed in goggles (analog)
   - ELRS receiver connected (RSSI displayed)
   - OSD shows battery voltage (~25.2V for full 6S)

3. **Test VTX at Higher Power**:
   - Switch VTX to 200mW or 400mW via OSD
   - Verify VTX handles power (not overheating)
   - Verify video quality stable
   - Return to pit mode when done

4. **Test Motor Outputs** (props OFF!):
   - Betaflight Motors tab
   - Slowly increase motor sliders (one at a time)
   - Verify all 4 motors spin correctly
   - No strange noises or vibrations
   - Return sliders to zero

5. **Arm Test** (props OFF!):
   - Arm aircraft via transmitter
   - Verify arming successful
   - Check OSD flight timer starts
   - Disarm aircraft

**Expected Result**: All systems operational, ready for props and first flight ✅

---

### 6. Pre-Flight Final Checks

**Before Installing Props**:

1. **Antenna Routing Verification**:
   - ELRS primary antenna: 17.5mm CF clearance ✅
   - ELRS secondary antenna: 4mm CF clearance ⚠️ (marginal - monitor for signal issues)
   - VTX antenna: Clear of props, 45° angle rear ✅
   - No antennas touching carbon fiber

## Operator Preferences / Build Philosophy

**SpyD (Franco Nogarin) - Build Approach**:
- Self-sufficient: Designs/prints custom parts (Bambu X1C + AMS)
- Pragmatic: Tests components before committing (TX800 failure validated concerns)
- Resourceful: Photo → GIMP → Inkscape → Slicer workflow (no CAD software)
- Quality-focused: Twisted wire pairs for EMI, proper strain relief
- Strategic thinker: Evaluated ArduPilot mapping thoroughly before rejecting

**Documentation Style**:
- Appreciates technical accuracy over hand-holding
- Values engineering rationale ("why" not just "what")
- Expects archivist role (document, don't instruct unless asked)
- Calls out incorrect assumptions (DJI Mini 4 Pro not suitable for mapping)

**Decision-Making**:
- Research-driven: Investigated 5" frame jello issues independently
- Proven components: Prefers GEPRC RAD (already happy with it) over unknown
- Fleet strategy: Clear separation of roles (RD-59 cruiser, mapping platform separate)

---

## Strategic Context

**RD-59 Mission** (Finalized Nov 14):
- Manual FPV cruiser (10° camera angle, gentle flying)
- Analog video system (GEPRC RAD - maximizes flight time)
- Target flight time: 5-7 minutes
- NOT a mapping platform (5" frame unsuitable)
- NOT an aggressive freestyle drone (cruiser philosophy)

**Fleet Context**:
- **RD-53**: Manual FPV (short-range fun)
- **RD-54 "Zorro"**: Manual FPV (Walksnail → HDZero when arrives)
- **RD-55 "Flylens75"**: Manual FPV (Walksnail)
- **RD-59 "Nazgul"**: Manual FPV cruiser (analog, long flight time)
- **Future mapping drone**: Separate build (7" frame, ArduPilot, 12-20MP camera)

**HDZero System** (in transit):
- $830 investment (Goggle 2 + Freestyle V2 kit)
- Ordered Nov 2, 2025
- Expected delivery: Mid-November (any day now)
- **Allocated to RD-54** for performance flying
- NOT for RD-59 (analog better for cruiser role)

**Mapping Platform** (future project):
- 7" long-range frame required
- Low-KV motors (1200-1400KV)
- ArduPilot firmware (not Betaflight)
- 12-20MP camera (down-facing or gimbal-mounted)
- Professional WebODM workflow integration
- Separate from RD-59 entirely
